		<h2>News - Open air movie night</h2>
			<p>Something exciting is lighting up the apartment block this weekend â€” a Movie Night! Residents are invited to bring their 
				blankets, bean bags, and popcorn for an open-air cinema experience under the stars. The courtyard will be transformed 
				into a cozy viewing space, complete with string lights, a projector screen, and a selection of classic and family-friendly films.

				This is a new initiative by the Council to create more shared experiences and foster a stronger sense of community. 
				There will be a snack bar with popcorn and drinks. Kids can enjoy a animated feature early in the evening, followed by a main 
				feature for teens and adults.

				A great way to unwind, meet neighbours, and enjoy the beautiful night sky without leaving home. Vote for the movie in advance via the community portal</p>
